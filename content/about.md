Khonsu is the Ancient Egyptian god of the moon. His name means “Traveler,” and this may relate to the nightly travel of
the moon across the sky.

Along with Thoth he marked the passage of time. Khonsu was instrumental in the creation of new life in all living
creatures.

Khonsu also bore the titles of “Embracer,” “Pathfinder” and “Defender,” and was often represented as a child.

As such, Khonsu represents what this website stands for: **an endeavor to always travel, find our own path, and learn.**
